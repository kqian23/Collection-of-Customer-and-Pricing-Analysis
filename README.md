# Customer Analytics Projects

### 1. Customer Attitude Analysis
- Performed customer attitude segmentation using **PCA** 

### 2. Predicting Customer Response with Logistic Regression
- used **Logistic Regression** to predict 'customer response rate' (dependent variable) based on 'customer information' (independent variable)

### 3. Evaluating Market Structure with Multiple Regression
- Analyzed crossp price elasticity by running multiple **regression models (linear and semi-log)** on *'sales'* (dependent variable) and *'app information'* (independent variable) for three competing app
- Performed clout and vulnerability analysis

### 4. Modeling Lag Effect of Advertising Expenditure
- applied multiple **regression models (linear, concave log, and concave quadratic)** to predict *'number of visitors'*(dependent variable) using *'total dollar amount spent on advertising'* (independent variable)
- Analyzed long-run advertising elasticity and saturation

### 5. Pricing & Profitablity Analysis
- Analyzed sales quantity and profit under different pricing strategies
- Evaluated and quantified the impact of cross-price elasticity by competitive products

### 6. Pricing Cannibalization & Competition Analysis
- Extracted price elasticities from sales data by fitting **log-log regression models**. 
- Refine the models by controlling seasonal,store, and promotion effects
- Suggesting optimal pricing based on projected profit analysis
