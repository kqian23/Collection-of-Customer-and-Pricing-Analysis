# Customer Analytics Projects


### 1. Evaluating Market Structure with Multiple Regression
For this project I:
- applied three types of models (linear, concave log, and concave quadratic) to predict 'number of visitors'(dependent variable) using 'total dollar amount spent on advertising' (independent variable)
- improved the model by introducing exponential decaying log effect on 'total dollar amount spent on advertising'
- computed long-run advertising elasticity
- evaluated and selected the best model
- calculated the saturation level

### 2. Modeling Lag Effect of Advertising Expenditure
For this project I:
- Ran multiple regression (linear and semi-log) on 'sales data' (dependent variable) and 'app information' (independent variable) for three competing apps.
- Evaluated model strength and comprehensiveness.
- Calculated price elasticity.
- Performed clout and vulnerability analysis.


### 3. Predicting Customer Response with Logistic Regression
For this project I:
- spited the customer data into 'training' and 'testing' data
- built a logistic model on 'training' data to predict 'customer response rate' (dependent variable) based on 'customer information' (independent variable)
- scored each customer based on the logit model
- test the model performance on 'testing' data
- made suggestion on advertising strategy based on the model
